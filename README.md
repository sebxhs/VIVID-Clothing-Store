# VIVID-Clothing-Store# Clothing Store Website

## Description
This is a clothing store website that I originally developed for a project. I decided to code it again on my own time to address issues from my first submission and improve the overall structure, functionality, and user experience. This version incorporates better coding practices, optimized performance, and refined design elements.

## How to Run the Project
   ```
1. Open folder in vscode.

2. open terminal and run npm install
   ```
3. run npm run dev

## Challenges Faced & Solutions
- **Code Structure & Maintainability**: The first version had inconsistent formatting and inefficient HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structures. To fix this, I refactored the code, making it more modular and readable.
- **Responsive Design Issues**: The initial design had layout problems on mobile devices. I reworked the CSS grid and flexbox implementations to ensure better responsiveness.
- **Performance Optimization**: The original project had unoptimized images and excessive JavaScript calculations. I optimized images using modern formats (WebP) and minimized JavaScript execution time for a smoother experience.
- **Improved User Experience**: Based on feedback, I improved the navigation flow and refined the UI elements to make the shopping experience more seamless.
